- Start simple implementation
- Read termion tutorial
- (partial) Define functions to navigate through tree.
Think that there will be no confirmation to step into a node, in other words it will be a stream of characters.
After every character should try to select a `Tree`, if transition returns None, should wait for next input and try again.
Not sure when I would stop given that model.
Futhermore, how would the user remove items for the input stream?
